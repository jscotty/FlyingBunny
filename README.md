Java game made with own operator

The game I made with the libary I made for Scotty's adventure. 
When the project 'do it yourself' started I decided to create a game with my very own libary. I wanted to try and create a 
different sort of game then scotty adventure, in order to check if my libary worked well for other projects. 

Java Libary code:<br>
